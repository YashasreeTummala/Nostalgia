# ProGrad Lab | Angular - Photo Gallery

## Introduction

We all have things that make us nostalgic. The right song or image can transport us back to another place and time. Well its a different feeling altogether.

Not just you, everyone feels the same way. So, let's get a little nostalgic together by building a photo gallery using Angular.

## Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Create a static Angular application with Angular CLI.
- Build an Angular application with one component.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone this repo.

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Navigate to your repo and create a pull request from your master branch to the original repository's master branch. In the pull request name, add your Prograd id, name, and last name separated by a dash "-".

## Deliverables

You need to generate the starter code and fill it with the necessary code to satisfy the requirements described below.

## Starter Code

To generate the starter code, follow the steps given below

- To create a new application,
    - Open your ubuntu or cmd terminal and execute the following command
      - ```ng new app-name```
      - for example, ng new super-wars
    - To create a new component, execute the command 
      - ``` ng generate component component-name```
      - example, ng generate component contacts
      
## How to run

- To run the project go to your ubuntu terminal or VScode editor
    - open the ubuntu or cmd terminal or inside the vscode editor
    - run the command following command
    - ```ng serve --open or ng serve -o```


## Progression #1: PHOTO GALLERY

In the first progression, we are going to build a photo album. You can choose to pick photos of your childhood/family/friends or you can use the images given inside the src/assets folder. 

We will build this album in the `AppComponent` component. The album will have mutilple photos, and **it's not necessary to have an array to store these values**.

Easy, right? Add some styles to the album page to give your photo album a little flair!

## Progression #2: HEADER and FOOTER (Optional)

In the second progression, we are going to generate two component header and footer. Have the page heading inside the header part and 
'Made with by ❤️ ProGrads' in the footer part
